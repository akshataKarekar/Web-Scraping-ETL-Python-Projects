Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) operations are of extreme importance in the role of a Data engineer. A data engineer extracts data from multiple sources and different file formats, transforms the extracted data to predefined settings and then loads the data to a database for further processing.

In these 2 projects I have done the below:
Read CSV, JSON, and XML file types.
Extract the required data from the different file types.
Transform data to the required format.
Save the transformed data in a ready-to-load format, which can be loaded into an RDBMS.

Project 1

An international firm that is looking to expand its business in different countries across the world has recruited you. You have been hired as a junior Data Engineer and are tasked with creating an automated script that can extract the list of all countries in order of their GDPs in billion USDs (rounded to 2 decimal places), as logged by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Since IMF releases this evaluation twice a year, this code will be used by the organization to extract the information as it is updated.

Your boss wants you to demonstrate the success of this code by running a query on the database table to display only the entries with more than a 100 billion USD economy. Also, you should log in a file with the entire process of execution

Project 2
In this imaginary scenario, I have been hired as a data engineer by research organization. My boss has asked me to create a code that can be used to compile the list of the top 10 largest banks in the world ranked by market capitalization in billion USD. Further, the data needs to be transformed and stored in GBP, EUR and INR as well, in accordance with the exchange rate information that has been made available to you as a CSV file. The processed information table is to be saved locally in a CSV format and as a database table.

My job is to create an automated system to generate this information so that the same can be executed in every financial quarter to prepare the report.
