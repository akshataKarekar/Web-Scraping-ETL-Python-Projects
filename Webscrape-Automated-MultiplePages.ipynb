The origins of music remain highly contentious; commentators often relate it to the origin of language, with much disagreement surrounding whether music arose before, after or simultaneously with language. Many theories have been proposed by scholars from a wide range of disciplines, though none has achieved broad approval. Most cultures have their own mythical origins concerning the invention of music, generally rooted in their respective mythological, religious or philosophical beliefs.\\nThe music of prehistoric cultures is first firmly dated to c.\\u200940,000\\xa0BP of the Upper Paleolithic by evidence of bone flutes, though it remains unclear whether or not the actual origins lie in the earlier Middle Paleolithic period (300,000 to 50,000\\xa0BP). There is little known about prehistoric music, with traces mainly limited to some simple flutes and percussion instruments. However, such evidence indicates that music existed to some extent in prehistoric societies such as the Xia dynasty and the Indus Valley civilisation. Upon the development of writing, the music of literate civilizations—ancient music—was present in the major Chinese, Egyptian, Greek, Indian, Persian, Mesopotamian, and Middle Eastern societies. It is difficult to make many generalizations about ancient music as a whole, but from what is known it was often characterized by monophony and improvisation. In ancient song forms, the texts were closely aligned with music, and though the oldest extant musical notation survives from this period, many texts survive without their accompanying music, such as the Rigveda and the Shijing Classic of Poetry. The eventual emergence of the Silk Road and increasing contact between cultures led to the transmission and exchange of musical ideas, practices, and instruments. Such interaction led to the Tang dynasty\\'s music being heavily influenced by Central Asian traditions, while the Tang dynasty\\'s music, the Japanese gagaku and Korean court music each influenced each other.\\nHistorically, religions have often been catalysts for music. The Vedas of Hinduism immensely influenced Indian classical music, and the Five Classics of Confucianism laid the basis for subsequent Chinese music. Following the rapid spread of Islam in the 6th century, Islamic music dominated Persia and the Arab world, and the Islamic Golden Age saw the presence of numerous important music theorists. Music written for and by the early Christian Church properly inaugurates the Western classical music tradition,[1] which continues into medieval music where polyphony, staff notation and nascent forms of many modern instruments developed. In addition to religion or the lack thereof, a society\\'s music is influenced by all other aspects of its culture, including social and economic organization and experience, climate, and access to technology. Many cultures have coupled music with other art forms, such as the Chinese four arts and the medieval quadrivium. The emotions and ideas that music expresses, the situations in which music is played and listened to, and the attitudes toward musicians and composers all vary between regions and periods. Many cultures have or continue to distinguish between art music (or \\'classical music\\'), folk music, and popular music.\\n\"But that music is a language by whose means messages are elaborated, that such messages can be understood by the many but sent out only by the few, and that it alone among all language unites the contradictory character of being at once intelligible and untranslatable—these facts make the creator of music a being like the gods and make music itself the supreme mystery of human knowledge.\"\\nClaude Lévi-Strauss, The Raw and the Cooked[2]Music is regarded as a cultural universal,[3][4] though definitions of it vary depending on culture and throughout history.[5] As with many aspects of human cognition, it remains debated as to what extent the origins of music will ever be understood, with scholars often taking polarizing positions.[6] The origin of music is often discussed alongside the origin of language, with the nature of their connection being the subject of much debate.[7] However, before the mid-late 20th century, both topics were seldom given substantial attention by academics.[8][9][n 1] Since the topic\\'s resurgence, the principal source of contention is divided into three perspectives: whether music began as a kind of proto-language (a result of adaptation) that led to language; if music is a spandrel (a phenotypic by-product of evolution) that was the result of language; or if music and language both derived from a common antecedent.[11][12][n 2][n 3]\\nThere is little consensus on any particular theory for the origin of music, which have included contributions from archaeologists, cognitive scientists, ethnomusicologists, evolutionary biologists, linguists, neuroscientists, paleoanthropologists, philosophers, and psychologists (developmental and social).[21][n 4] Some of the most prominent theories are as follows:\\nMany cultures have their own mythical origins on the creation of music.[32][33] Specific figures are sometimes credited with inventing music, such as Jubal in Christian mythology,[25] the legendary Shah Jamshid in Persian/Iranian mythology,[34] the goddess Saraswati in Hinduism,[35] and the muses in Ancient Greek mythology.[33] Some cultures credit multiple originators of music; ancient Egyptian mythology associates it with numerous deities, including Amun, Hathor, Isis and Osiris, but especially Ihy.[36] There are many stories relating to music\\'s origins in Chinese mythology,[37][n 5] but the most prominent is that of the musician Ling Lun, who—on the orders of the Yellow Emperor (Huangdi)—invented bamboo flute by imitating the song of the mythical fenghuang birds.[38]\\nIn the broadest sense, prehistoric music—more commonly termed primitive music in the past[41][42][n 6]—encompasses all music produced in preliterate cultures (prehistory), beginning at least 6 million years ago when humans and chimpanzees last had a common ancestor.[43] Music first arose in the Paleolithic period,[44] though it remains unclear as to whether this was the Middle (300,000 to 50,000\\xa0BP) or Upper Paleolithic (50,000 to 12,000\\xa0BP).[45] The vast majority of Paleolithic instruments have been found in Europe and date to the Upper Paleolithic.[46] It is certainly possible that singing emerged far before this time, though this is essentially impossible to confirm.[47] The potentially oldest instrument is the Divje Babe Flute from the Divje Babe cave in Slovenia, dated to 43,000 and 82,000 and made from a young cave bear femur.[48] Purportedly used by Neanderthals, the Divje Babe Flute has received extensive scholarly attention, and whether it is truly a musical instrument or an object formed by animals is the subject of intense debate.[39] If the former, it would be the oldest known musical instrument and evidence of a musical culture in the Middle Paleolithic.[49] Other than the Divje Babe Flute and three other doubtful flutes,[n 7] there is virtually no surviving Middle Paleolithic musical evidence of any certainty, similar to the situation in regards to visual art.[44] The earliest objects whose designations as musical instruments are widely accepted are bone flutes from the Swabian Jura, Germany, namely from the Geissenklösterle, Hohle Fels and Vogelherd caves.[50] Dated to the Aurignacian (of the Upper Paleolithic) and used by Early European modern humans, from all three caves there are eight examples, four made from the wing bones of birds and four from mammoth ivory; three of these are near complete.[50] Three flutes from the Geissenklösterle are dated as the oldest, c.\\u200943,150–39,370 BP.[51][n 8]\\nConsidering the relative complexity of flutes, it is likely earlier instruments existed, akin to objects that are common in later hunter and gatherer societies, such as rattles, shakers, and drums.[47] The absence of other instruments from and before this time may be due to their use of weaker—and thus more biodegradable—materials,[44] such as reeds, gourds, skins, and bark.[52] A painting in the Cave of the Trois-Frères dating to c.\\u200915,000 BCE is thought to depict a shaman playing a musical bow.[53]\\nPrehistoric cultures are thought to have had a wide variety of uses for music, with little unification between different societies.[54] Music was likely of particular value when food and other basic needs were scarce.[54] It is also probable that prehistoric cultures viewed music as intrinsically connected with nature, and may have believed its use influenced the natural world directly.[54]\\nThe earliest instruments found in prehistoric China are 12 gudi bone flutes in the modern-day Jiahu, Wuyang, Henan Province from c.\\u20096000 BCE.[55][56][n 9][n 10] The only instruments dated to the prehistoric Xia dynasty (c.\\u20092070–1600) are two qing, two small bells (one earthenware, one bronze), and a xun.[58] Due to this extreme scarcity of surviving instruments and the general uncertainty surrounding most of the Xia, creating a musical narrative of the period is impractical.[58] In the Indian subcontinent, the prehistoric Indus Valley civilisation (from c.\\u20092500–2000 BCE in its mature state) has archeological evidence that indicates simple rattles and vessel flutes were used, while iconographical evidence suggests early harps and drums also existed.[59] An ideogram in the later IVC contains the earliest known depiction of an arched harp, dated sometime before 1800 BCE.[60]\\nFollowing the advent of writing, literate civilizations are termed part of the ancient world, the first of which is Sumerian literature of Abu Salabikh (now Southern Iraq) of c.\\u20092600 BCE[61] Though the music of Ancient societies was extremely diverse, some fundamental concepts arise prominently in virtually all of them, namely monophony, improvisation and the dominance of text in musical settings.[62] Varying song forms were present in Ancient cultures, including China, Egypt, Greece, India, Mesopotamia, Rome, and the Middle East.[63] The text, rhythm, and melodies of these songs were closely aligned, as was music in general, with magic, science, and religion.[63] Complex song forms developed in later ancient societies, particularly the national festivals of China, Greece, and India.[63] Later Ancient societies also saw increased trade and transmission of musical ideas and instruments, often shepherded by the Silk Road.[64][65] For example, a tuning key for a qin-zither from 4th–5th centuries BCE China includes considerable Persian iconography.[66] In general, not enough information exists to make many other generalizations about ancient music between cultures.[63]\\nThe few actual examples of ancient music notation that survive usually exist on papyrus or clay tablets.[63] Information on musical practices, genres, and thought is mainly available through literature, visual depictions, and increasingly as the period progresses, instruments.[63] The oldest surviving written music is the Hurrian songs from Ugarit, Syria. Of these, the oldest is the Hymn to Nikkal (hymn no. 6; h. 6), which is somewhat complete and dated to c.\\u20091400 BCE.[67] However, the Seikilos epitaph is the earliest entirely complete noted musical composition. Dated to the 2nd Century CE or later, it is an epitaph, perhaps for the wife of the unknown Seikilos.[68]\\nThey strike the bells, kin, kin,They play the se-zither, play the qin-zither,The mouth organ and chime stones sound together;They sing the Ya and Nan Odes,And perform flawlessly upon their flutes.\\nShijing, Ode 208, Gu Zhong[69]Translated by John S. Major[70]By the mid-13th century BCE, the late Shang dynasty (1600–1046 BCE) had developed writing, which mostly exists as divinatory inscriptions on the ritualistic oracle bones but also as bronze inscriptions.[71][72] As many as 11 oracle script characters may refer to music to some extent, some of which could be iconographical representations of instruments themselves.[73] The stone bells qing appears to have been particularly popular with the Shang ruling class,[n 11] and while no surviving flutes have been dated to the Shang,[75] oracle script evidence suggests they used ocarinas (xun), transverse flute (xiao and dizi), douple pipes, the mouthorgan (sheng), and maybe the pan flute (paixiao).[76][n 12] Due to the advent of the bronze in 2000 BCE,[78] the Shang used the material for bells—the ling\\xa0[zh] (鈴), nao\\xa0[zh] (鐃) and zhong (鐘)[57]—that can be differentiated in two ways: those with or without a clapper and those struck on the inside or outside.[79] Drums, which are not found from before the Shang,[80] sometimes used bronze, though they were more often wooden (bangu).[81][57][n 13] The aforementioned wind instruments certainly existed by the Zhou dynasty (1046–256 BCE), as did the first Chinese string instruments: the qin (or guqin) and se zithers.[57][n 14] The Zhou saw the emergence of major court ensembles and the well known Tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng (after 433 BCE) contains a variety of complex and decorated instruments.[57] Of the tomb, the by-far most notable instrument is the monumental set of 65 tuned bianzhong bells, which range five octaves requiring at least five players; they are still playable and include rare inscriptions on music.[84]\\nAncient Chinese instruments served both practical and ceremonial means. People used them to appeal to supernatural forces for survival needs,[85] while pan flutes may have been used to attract birds while hunting,[86] and drums were common in sacrifices and military ceremonies.[80] Chinese music has always been closely associated with dance, literature and fine arts;[87] many early Chinese thinkers also equated music with proper morality and governance of society.[88][n 15] Throughout the Shang and Zhou music was a symbol of power for the Imperial court,[91] being used in religious services as well as the celebration of ancestors and heroes.[85][92] Confucius (c.\\u2009551–479) formally designated the music concerned with ritual and ideal morality as the superior yayue (雅樂; \"proper music\"), in opposition to suyue (俗樂; \"vernacular/popular music\"),[85][93] which included virtually all non-ceremonial music, but particularly any that was considered excessive or lascivious.[93] During the Warring States Period when of Confucius\\'s lifetime, officials often ignored this distinction, preferring more lively suyue music and using the older yayue traditional solely for political means.[94] Confucius and disciples such as Mencius considered this preference virtueless and saw ill of the leaders\\' ignorance of ganying,[95] a theory that held music was intrinsically connected to the universe.[96][97][n 16] Thus, many aspects of Ancient Chinese music were aligned with cosmology: the 12 pitch shí-èr-lǜ system corresponded equally with certain weights and measurements; the pentatonic scale with the five wuxing;[97] and the eight tone classification of Chinese instruments of bayin with the eight symbols of bagua.[98] No actual music or texts on the performance practices of Ancient Chinese musicians survive.[99] The Five Classics of the Zhou dynasty include musical commentary; the I Ching and Chunqiu Spring and Autumn Annals make references, while the Liji Book of Rites contains a substantial discussion (see the chapter Yue Ji Record of Music).[38] While the Yue Jing Classic of Music is lost,[78] the Shijing Classic of Poetry contains 160 texts to now lost songs from the Western Zhou period (1045–771).[100]\\nThe Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE), established by Qin Shi Huang, lasted for only 15 years, but the purported burning of books resulted in a substantial loss of previous musical literature.[65] The Qin saw the guzheng become a particularly popular instrument; as a more portable and louder zither, it meet the needs of an emerging popular music scene.[101][n 17] During the Han dynasty (202 BCE – 220 CE), there were attempts to reconstruct the music of the Shang and Zhou, as it was now \"idealized as perfect\".[98][65] A Music Bureau, the Yuefu, was founded or at its height by at least 120 BCE under Emperor Wu of Han,[102][n 18] and was responsible for collecting folksongs. The purpose of this was twofold; it allowed the Imperial Court to properly understand the thoughts of the common people,[87] and it was also an opportunity for the Imperial Court to adapt and manipulate the songs to suit propaganda and political purposes.[98][65][n 19] Employing ceremonial, entertainment-oriented and military musicians,[104] the Bureau also performed at a variety of venues, wrote new music, and set music to commissioned poetry by noted figures such as Sima Xiangru.[105] The Han dynasty had officially adopted Confucianism as the state philosophy,[65] and the ganying theories became a dominant philosophy.[106] In practice, however, many officials ignored or downplayed Confucius\\'s high regard for yayue over suyue music, preferring to engage in the more lively and informal later.[107] By 7 BCE the Bureau employed 829 musicians; that year Emperor Ai either disbanded or downsized the department,[65][105] due to financial limitations,[65] and the Bureau\\'s increasingly prominent suyue music which conflicted with Confucianism.[104] The Han dynasty saw a preponderance of foreign musical influences from the Middle East and Central Asia: the emerging Silk Road led to the exchange of musical instruments,[64] and allowed travelers such as Zhang Qian to relay with new musical genres and techniques.[65] Instruments from said cultural transmission include metal trumpets and instruments similar to the modern oboe and oud lute, the latter which became the pipa.[64] Other preexisting instruments greatly increased in popularity, such as the qing,[86] panpipes,[108] and particularly the qin-zither (or guqin), which was from then on the most revered instrument, associated with good character and morality.[83]\\nGreek written history extends far back into Ancient Greece, and was a major part of ancient Greek theatre. In ancient Greece, mixed-gender choruses performed for entertainment, celebration and spiritual reasons.[citation needed] Instruments included the most important wind instrument, the double-reed aulos,[109] as well as the plucked string instrument, the lyre,[110] especially the special kind called a kithara.\\nThe principal sources on the music of ancient India are textual and iconographical; specifically, some theoretical treatises in Sanskrit survive, there are brief mentions in general literature and many sculptures of Ancient Indian musicians and their instruments exist.[111] Ancient Sanskrit, Pali, and Prakrit literature frequently contains musical references, from the Vedas to the works of Kalidasa and the Ilango Adigal\\'s epic Silappatikaram.[112] Despite this, little is known on the actual musical practices of ancient India and the information available forces a somewhat homogeneous perspective on the music of the time, even though evidence indicates that in reality, it was far more diverse.[111]\\nThe monumental arts treatise Natya Shastra is among the earliest and chief sources for Ancient Indian music; the music portions alone are likely from the Gupta period (4th century to 6th century CE).[113]\\nIn general, it is impossible to create a thorough outline of the earliest music in Persia due to a paucity of surviving records.[114] Evidenced by c.\\u20093300–3100 BCE Elam depictions, arched harps are the first affirmation of Persian music, though it is probable that they existed well before their artistic depictions.[115] Elamite bull lyres from c.\\u20092450 have been found in Susa, while more than 40 small Oxus trumpets have been found in Bactria and Margiana, dated to the c.\\u20092200–1750 Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex.[116][n 20] The oxus trumpets seem to have had a close association with both religion and animals; a Zoroastrian myth in which Jamshid attract animals with the trumpet suggests that the Elamites used them for hunting.[117] In many ways the earliest known musical cultures of Iran are strongly connected with those of Mesopotamia. Ancient arched harps (c.\\u20093000) also exist in the latter and the scarcity of instruments makes it unclear as to which culture the harp originated.[115] Far more bull lyres survive in Ur of Mesopotamia, notably the Bull Headed Lyre of Ur, though they are nearly identical to their contemporary Elamite counterparts.[118] From the evidence in terracotta plaques, by the 2nd-century BCE the arched harp was displaced by the angular harps, which existed in 20-string vertical and nine-string horizontal variants.[119] Lutes were purportedly used in Mesopotamia by at least 2300 BCE, but not until c.\\u20091300 BCE do they appear in Iran, where they became the dominant string instruments of Western Iran, though the available evidence suggests its popularity was outside of the elite.[120] The rock reliefs of Kul-e Farah show that sophisticated Persian court ensembles emerged in the 1st-century BCE, in the which the central instrument was the arched harp.[121] The prominence of musicians in these certain rock reliefs suggests they were essential in religious ceremonies.[122]\\nLike earlier periods, extremely little contemporary information on the music of the Achaemenid Empire (550–330 BCE) exists.[66][123] Most knowledge on the Achaemenid musical culture comes from Greek historians.[123] In his Histories, Herodotus noted that Achaemenid priests did not use aulos music in their ceremonies, while Xenophon reflected on his visit to Persia in the Cyropaedia, mentioning the presence of many female singers at court.[66] Athenaeus also mentions female singers when noting that 329 of them had been taken from the King of Kings Darius III by Macedonian general Parmenion.[66] Later Persian texts assert that gōsān poet-musician minstrels were prominent and of considerable status in court.[124]\\nThe Parthian Empire (247 BCE to 224 CE) saw an increase in textual and iconographical depictions of musical activity and instruments. 2nd century BCE Parthian rhuta (drinking horns) found in the ancient capital of Nisa include some of the most vivid depictions of musicians from the time. Pictorial evidence such as terracotta plaques show female harpists, while plaques from Babylon show panpipes, as well as string (harps, lutes and lyres) and percussion instruments (tambourines and clappe\n\n*** WARNING: max output size exceeded, skipping output. ***\n\n lineage and history of musical therapy being utilized throughout the culture. The most common people associated with music therapy are herbalists, Witch doctors, and faith healers according to Professor Charles O. Aluede of Ambrose Alli University (Ekpoma, Edo State, Nigeria).[106] Applying music and thematic sounds to the healing process is believed to help the patient overcome true sickness in his/her mind which then will seemingly cure the disease. Another practice involving music is called \"Igbeuku\", a religious practice performed by faith healers. In the practice of Igbeuku, patients are persuaded to confess their sins which cause themselves serve discomfort. Following a confession, patients feel emotionally relieved because the priest has announced them clean and subjected them to a rigorous dancing exercise. The dancing exercise is a \"thank you\" for the healing and tribute to the spiritual greater beings. The dance is accompanied by music and can be included among the unorthodox medical practices of Nigerian culture. While most of the music therapy practices come in the medical field, musical therapy is often used in the passing of a loved one. The use of song and dance in a funeral setting is very common across the continent but especially in Nigeria. Songs allude to the idea the finally resting place is Hades (hell). The music helps alleviate the sorrows felt by the family members and friends of the lost loved one. Along with music therapy being a practice for funeral events, it is also implemented to those dying as a last resort tactic of healing. The Esan of Edo State of Nigeria, in particular, herbalists perform practices with an Oko – a small aerophone made of elephant tusk which is blown into dying patients\\' ears to resuscitate them. Nigeria is full of interesting cultural practices in which contribute a lot to the music therapy world.[citation needed]\\nThere are longstanding traditions of music healing, which in some ways may be very different than music therapy.[107]\\nMercédès Pavlicevic (1955-2018),[108][109] an international music therapist, along with Kobie Temmingh, pioneered the music therapy program at the University of Pretoria, which debuted with a master\\'s degree program in 1999. She noted the differences in longstanding traditions and other ways of viewing healing or music. A Nigerian colleague felt \"that music in Africa is healing, and what is music therapy other than some colonial import?\"[107] Pavlicevic noted that \"in Africa there is a long tradition of music healing\" and asked \"Can there be a synthesis of these two music-based practices towards something new?... I am not altogether convinced that African music healing and music therapy are especially closely related [emphasis added]. But I am utterly convinced that music therapy can learn an enormous amount from the African worldview and from music-making in Africa – rather than from African music-healing as such.\"[107]\\nThe South African Music Therapy Association can provide information to the public about music therapy or educational programs in South Africa.[110]\\nSouth Africa was selected to host the 16th World Congress of Music Therapy in July 2020, a triennial World Federation of Music Therapy event.  Due to the coronavirus pandemic (SARS-CoV-2) the congress was moved to an online event.[111]\\nThe states of Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, North Dakota, Nevada, New Jersey,[115] Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Virginia[116] have established licenses for music therapists,[117][118] while in Wisconsin, music therapists must be registered, and in Utah hold state certification.[117][118] In the State of New York, the Creative Arts Therapy license (LCAT) incorporates the music therapy credential within their licensure, a mental health license that requires a master\\'s degree and post-graduate supervision.[119] The states of California and Connecticut have title protection[118] for music therapists, meaning only those with the MT-BC credential can use the title \"Board Certified Music Therapist\".\\nThe American Music Therapy Association (AMTA).\\nPublication on music therapy education and training has been detailed in both single author (Goodman, 2011) and edited (Goodman, 2015, 2023) volumes. The register of the European Music Therapy Confederation lists all educational training programs throughout Europe.\\nA music therapy degree candidate can earn an undergraduate, master\\'s or doctoral degree in music therapy. Many AMTA approved programs in the United States offer equivalency and certificate degrees in music therapy for students that have completed a degree in a related field. Some practicing music therapists have held PhDs either in music therapy or in fields related to music therapy. A music therapist typically incorporates music therapy techniques with broader clinical practices such as psychotherapy, rehabilitation, and other practices depending on client needs. Music therapy services rendered within the context of a social service, educational, or health care agency are often reimbursable by insurance or other sources of funding for individuals with certain needs.\\nA degree in music therapy requires proficiency in guitar, piano, voice, music theory, music history, reading music, improvisation, as well as varying levels of skill in assessment, documentation, and other counseling and health care skills depending on the focus of the particular university\\'s program. 1200 hours of clinical experience are required, some of which are gained during an approximately six-month internship that takes place after all other degree requirements are met.[112]\\nAfter successful completion of educational requirements, including internship, music therapists can apply to take, take, and pass the Board Certification Examination in Music Therapy.\\nThe current national credential is MT-BC (Music Therapist-Board Certified). It is not required in all states. To be eligible to apply to take the Board Certification Examination in Music Therapy, an individual must successfully complete a music therapy degree from a program accredited by AMTA at a college or university (or have a bachelor\\'s degree and complete all of the music therapy course requirements from an accredited program), which includes successfully completing a music therapy internship. To maintain the credential, 100 units of continuing education must be completed every five years. The board exam is created by and administered through The Certification Board for Music Therapists.[112][120]\\nFor earlier history related to western traditions, see §\\xa0Western cultures sub-section.\\nFrom a western viewpoint, music therapy in the 20th and 21st centuries (as of 2021), as an evidence-based, allied healthcare profession, grew out of the aftermath of World Wars I and II, when, particularly in the United Kingdom and United States, musicians would travel to hospitals and play music for soldiers suffering from with war-related emotional and physical trauma.[60][121][122] Using music to treat the mental and physical ailments of active duty military and veterans was not new. Its use was recorded during the U.S. Civil War and Florence Nightingale used it a decade earlier in the Crimean War.[123] Despite research data, observations by doctors and nurses, praise from patients, and willing musicians, it was difficult to vastly increase music therapy services or establish lasting music therapy education programs or organizations in the early 20th century.[60][121] However, many of the music therapy leaders of this time period provided music therapy during WWI or to its veterans.  These were pioneers in the field such as Eva Vescelius, musician, author, 1903 founder of the short-lived National Therapeutic Society of New York and the 1913 Music and Health journal, and creator/teacher of a musicotherapy course; Margaret Anderton, pianist, WWI music therapy provider for Canadian soldiers, a strong believer in training for music therapists, and 1919 Columbia University musicotherapy teacher; Isa Maud Ilsen, a nurse and musician who was the American Red Cross Director of Hospital Music in WWI reconstruction hospitals, 1919 Columbia University musicotherapy teacher, 1926 founder of the National Association for Music in Hospitals, and author; and Harriet Ayer Seymour, music therapist to WWI veterans, author, researcher, lecturer/teacher, founder of the National Foundation for Music Therapy in 1941, author of the first music therapy textbook published in the US. Several physicians also promoted music as a therapeutic agent during this time period.[60][121]\\nIn the 1940s, changes in philosophy regarding care of psychiatric patients as well as the influx of WWII veterans in Veterans Administration hospitals renewed interest in music programs for patients.[60][121] Many musicians volunteered to provide entertainment and were primarily assigned to perform on psychiatric wards. Positive changes in patients\\' mental and physical health were noted by nurses. The volunteer musicians, many of whom had degrees in music education, becoming aware of the powerful effects music could have on patients realized that specialized training was necessary.[60][121] The first music therapy bachelor\\'s degree program was established in 1944 with three others and one master\\'s degree program quickly following: \"Michigan State College [now a University] (1944), the University of Kansas\\xa0[master\\'s degree only] (1946), the College of the Pacific (1947),\\xa0The Chicago Musical College (1948) and Alverno College (1948).\" The National Association for Music Therapy (NAMT), a professional association, was formed in 1950.[124] In 1956 the first music therapy credential in the US, Registered Music Therapist (RMT), was instituted by the NAMT.[60]\\nThe American Music Therapy Association (AMTA) was founded in 1998 as a merger between the National Association for Music Therapy (NAMT, founded in 1950)[125] and the American Association for Music Therapy (AAMT, founded in 1971).[126]\\nLive music was used in hospitals after both World Wars as part of the treatment program for recovering soldiers. Clinical music therapy in Britain as it is understood today was pioneered in the 1960s and 1970s by French cellist Juliette Alvin whose influence on the current generation of British music therapy lecturers remains strong. Mary Priestley, one of Juliette Alvin\\'s students, created \"analytical music therapy\". The Nordoff-Robbins approach to music therapy developed from the work of Paul Nordoff and Clive Robbins in the 1950/60s.\\nPractitioners are registered with the Health Professions Council and, starting from 2007, new registrants must normally hold a master\\'s degree in music therapy. There are master\\'s level programs in music therapy in Manchester, Bristol, Cambridge, South Wales, Edinburgh and London, and there are therapists throughout the UK. The professional body in the UK is the British Association for Music Therapy[127] In 2002, the World Congress of Music Therapy, coordinated and promoted by the World Federation of Music Therapy, was held in Oxford on the theme of Dialogue and Debate.[128] In November 2006, Dr. Michael J. Crawford and his colleagues again found that music therapy helped the outcomes of schizophrenic patients.[129][130]\\nMusic therapy finds its roots in the military. The United States Department of War issued Technical Bulletin 187 in 1945, which described the use of music in the recovery of military service members in Army hospitals.[131] The use of music therapy in military settings started to flourish and develop following World War II and research and endorsements from both the United States Army and the Surgeon General of the United States. Although these endorsements helped music therapy develop, there was still a recognized need to assess the true viability and value of music as a medically based therapy. Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the Office of the Surgeon General worked together to lead one of the earliest assessments of a music therapy program. The goal of the study was to understand whether \"music presented according to a specific plan\" influenced recovery among service members with mental and emotional disorders.[132] Eventually, case reports in reference to this study relayed not only the importance but also the impact of music therapy services in the recovery of military service personnel.\\nThe first university sponsored music therapy course was taught by Margaret Anderton in 1919 at Columbia University.[133] Anderton\\'s clinical specialty was working with wounded Canadian soldiers during World War II, using music-based services to aid in their recovery process.\\nToday, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom have both presented an array of injuries; however, the two signature injuries are posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI). These two signature injuries are increasingly common among millennial military service members and in music therapy programs.\\nA person diagnosed with PTSD can associate a memory or experience with a song they have heard. This can result in either good or bad experiences. If it is a bad experience, the song\\'s rhythm or lyrics can bring out the person\\'s anxiety or fear response. If it is a good experience, the song can bring feelings of happiness or peace which could bring back positive emotions. Either way, music can be used as a tool to bring emotions forward and help the person cope with them.\\nMusic therapists work with active duty military personnel, veterans, service members in transition, and their families. Music therapists strive to engage clients in music experiences that foster trust and complete participation over the course of their treatment process. Music therapists use an array of music-centered tools, techniques, and activities when working with military-associated clients, many of which are similar to the techniques used in other music therapy settings. These methods include, but are not limited to: group drumming, listening, singing, and songwriting. Songwriting is a particularly effective tool with military veterans struggling with PTSD and TBI as it creates a safe space to, \"... work through traumatic experiences, and transform traumatic memories into healthier associations\".[134]\\nMusic therapy in the military is seen in programs on military bases, VA healthcare facilities, military treatment facilities, and military communities. Music therapy programs have a large outreach because they exist for all phases of military life: pre-mobilization, deployment, post-deployment, recovery (in the case of injury), and among families of fallen military service personnel.[135]\\nThe Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) also exists to provide music therapy services to active duty military families who have a family member with a developmental, physical, emotional, or intellectual disorder. Currently, programs at the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Resounding Joy, Inc., and the Music Institute of Chicago partner with EFMP services to provide music therapy services to eligible military family members.[135]\\nMusic therapy programs primarily target active duty military members and their treatment facility to provide reconditioning among members convalescing in Army hospitals.[136] Although, music therapy programs not only benefit the military but rather a wide range of clients including the U.S. Air Force, American Navy, and U.S. Marines Corp. Individuals exposed to trauma benefit from their essential rehabilitative tools to follow the course of recovery from stress disorders. Music therapists are certified professionals who possess the abilities to determine appropriate interventions to support one recovering from a physically, emotionally, or mentally traumatic experience.[137] In addition to their skills, they play an integral part throughout the treatment process of service members diagnosed with post-traumatic stress or brain injuries. In many cases, self-expression through songwriting or using instruments help restore emotions that can be lost following trauma.[137] Music has a significant effect on troops traveling overseas or between bases because many soldiers view music to be an escape from war, a connection to their homeland and families, or as motivation. By working with a certified music therapist, marines undergo sessions re-instituting concepts of cognition, memory attention, and emotional processing.[138] Although programs primarily focus on phases of military life, other service members such as the U.S. Air Force are eligible for treatment as well. For instance, during a music therapy session, a man begins to play a song to a wounded Airmen. The Airmen says \" [music] allows me to talk about something that happened without talking about it\".[139] Music allows the active duty airmen to open up about previous experiences while reducing his anxiety level.\\nThe use of music to soothe grief has been used since the time of David and King Saul. In I Samuel, David plays the lyre to make King Saul feel relieved and better.  It has since been used all over the world for treatment of various issues, though the first recorded use of official \"music therapy\" was in 1789 – an article titled \"Music Physically Considered\" by an unknown author was found in Columbian Magazine.  The creation and expansion of music therapy as a treatment modality thrived in the early to mid 1900s and while a number of organizations were created, none survived for long.  It wasn\\'t until 1950 that the National Association for Music Therapy was founded in New York that clinical training and certification requirements were created. In 1971, the American Association for Music Therapy was created, though at that time called the Urban Federation of Music Therapists. The Certification Board for Music Therapists was created in 1983 which strengthened the practice of music therapy and the trust that it was given.  In 1998, the American Music Therapy Association was formed out of a merger between National and American Associations and as of 2017 is the single largest music therapy organization in the world (American music therapy, 1998–2011)[citation needed].\\nAncient flutes, carved from ivory and bone, were found by archaeologists, that were determined to be from as far back as 43,000 years ago. He also states that \"The earliest fragment of musical notation is found on a 4,000-year-old Sumerian clay tablet, which includes instructions and tuning for a hymn honoring the ruler Lipit-Ishtar. But for the title of oldest extant song, most historians point to \"Hurrian Hymn No. 6,\" an ode to the goddess Nikkal that was composed in cuneiform by the ancient Hurrian\\'s sometime around the 14th century B.C.\".[140]\\nMusic has been used as a healing implement for centuries.[141] Apollo is the ancient Greek god of music and of medicine and his son Aesculapius was said to cure diseases of the mind by using song and music. By 5000 BC, music was used for healing by Egyptian priest-physicians.[121] Plato said that music affected the emotions and could influence the character of an individual. Aristotle taught that music affects the soul and described music as a force that purified the emotions. Aulus Cornelius Celsus advocated the sound of cymbals and running water for the treatment of mental disorders. Music as therapy was practiced in the Bible when David played the harp to rid King Saul of a bad spirit (1 Sam 16:23).[142][page\\xa0needed] As early as 400 B.C., Hippocrates played music for mental patients. In the thirteenth century, Arab hospitals contained music-rooms for the benefit of the patients.[143] In the United States, Native American medicine men often employed chants and dances as a method of healing patients.[144] The Turco-Persian psychologist and music theorist al-Farabi (872–950), known as Alpharabius in Europe, dealt with music for healing in his treatise Meanings of the Intellect, in which he discussed the therapeutic effects of music on the soul.[145] In his De vita libri tres published in 1489, Platonist Marsilio Ficino gives a lengthy account of how music and songs can be used to draw celestial benefits for staying healthy.[146] Robert Burton wrote in the 17th century in his classic work, The Anatomy of Melancholy, that music and dance were critical in treating mental illness, especially melancholia.[147][148][149]\\nThe rise of an understanding of the body and mind in terms of the nervous system led to the emergence of a new wave of music for healing in the eighteenth century. Earlier works on the subject, such as Athanasius Kircher\\'s Musurgia Universalis of 1650 and even early eighteenth-century books such as Michael Ernst Ettmüller\\'s 1714 Disputatio effectus musicae in hominem (Disputation on the Effect of Music on Man) or Friedrich Erhardt Niedten\\'s 1717 Veritophili, still tended to discuss the medical effects of music in terms of bringing the soul and body into harmony. But from the mid-eighteenth century works on the subject such as Richard Brocklesby\\'s 1749 Reflections of Antient and Modern Musick, the 1737 Memoires of the French Academy of Sciences, or Ernst Anton Nicolai\\'s 1745 Die Verbindung der Musik mit der Arzneygelahrheit (The Connection of Music to Medicine), stressed the power of music over the nerves.[150]\\nAfter 1800, some books on music and medicine drew on the Brunonian system of medicine, arguing that the stimulation of the nerves caused by music could directly improve or harm health.[151] Throughout the 19th century, an impressive number of books and articles were authored by physicians in Europe and the United States discussing use of music as a therapeutic agent to treat both mental and physical illness.[121][60]\\nFrom a western viewpoint, music therapy in the 20th and 21st centuries (as of 2021), as an evidence-based, allied healthcare profession, grew out of the aftermath of World Wars I and II. Particularly in the United Kingdom and United States, musicians would travel to hospitals and play music for soldiers with war-related emotional and physical trauma.[60][121][122] Using music to treat the mental and physical ailments of active duty military and veterans was not new. Its use was recorded during the US Civil War and Florence Nightingale used it a decade earlier in the Crimean War.[123] Despite research data, observations by doctors and nurses, praise from patients, and willing musicians, it was difficult to vastly increase music therapy services or establish lasting music therapy education programs or organizations in the early 20th century.[60][121] However, many of the music therapy leaders of this time period provided music therapy during WWI or to its veterans.

Several physicians also promoted music as a therapeutic agent during this time period.[60][121]\\nIn the United States, the first music therapy bachelor\\'s degree program was established in 1944 at Michigan State College (now Michigan State University.[60]\\nFor history from the early 20th century to the present, see continents or individual countries in §\\xa0Usage by region section.\\n[152][153][154][155]\\nGoodman,K.D.(2011) Music therapy education and training: From theory to practice .
